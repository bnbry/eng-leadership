# Growth Mission Development

## Introduction

The purpose of a growth mission statement is to reflect on what you actually want out of your career
and personal growth in the near to mid term. Take some time to think about what you want out of the
the next year from a growth perspective. Focusing on the next year can help scope your mission

- Are you seeking a promotion?
- Do you want to improve any specific skills?
- Do you have gaps you want to fill?

Try these exercises out

- Imagine you're being congratulated for something you accomplished in 6 months, what would you
  want that to be?
- Imagine someone you work with today recognizes and comments on a positive change in your skills
  or behavior in 1 year, something you've improved at, what would that be?
- Imagine an announcement is made about a new role you are going to fill, what would that ideally
  be? A promotion? Becoming a manager? Architect? Project lead?

## My Growth Mission

This is my personal growth mission for 2023 that I'm sharing as an example. I want to be better at
everything but I'm particularly focused on picking up more of our tech stack, being a better leader
and communicator, and enabling the team. You'll also see some consistency with the themes of
Delivery, Development and Direction that I've raised in other contexts.

> I want to develop further as an engineer, leader and peer and be promoted to Senior Engineering
> Manager. I want to increase my knowledge of our tech stack, become a better communicator and
> better enable others to grow and succeed. I want my team to have a significant impact for the
> organization through delivering real customer value, influencing the technical direction, and
> developing as individuals.

## Growth Mission Examples

Here are several other examples of growth missions that cover a variety of potential growth
interests

> I want to improve as an engineer by continuing to build upon my strengths and fill my knowledge
> gaps. I want to gain a better understanding of software testing, become a polyglot developer and
> improve my ability to design technical solutions.

> I want to be promoted to Senior Software Engineer and gain more experience designing and leading
> technical projects.

> I want to design and create new technical solutions and get more involved across the organization
> with planning our technical direction.

> I want to continue to grow as a leader, coach and team member. I want to enable everyone around
> me to be more successful, grow in their careers, and better support each other. I want to increase
> my impact and grow my organizational influence.
