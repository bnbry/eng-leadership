# Growth Brainstorm

## Introduction

The first step of the growth process is to start brainstorming ideas. You need to spend time capturing the ways you would like to grow. This process should be raw and unedited. We'll iterate from this raw list by developing a growth mission and scoping three growth areas.

## Growth Ideas

List anything you want to learn, achieve, or grow in. Do not limit or edit yourself; list everything you can think of, and we'll iterate towards growth area categories.

**Examples**

- Learn Python
- Become an expert user of Postgres
- Get promoted to Senior Software Engineer
- Make a video game
- Lead a technical project
- Be a better code reviewer
