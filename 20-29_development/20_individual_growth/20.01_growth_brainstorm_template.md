# Growth Brainstorm

## Introduction

The first step of the growth process is to start brainstorming ideas. You need to spend time capturing the ways you would like to grown. This process should be raw and unedited, we'll iterate from this raw list by developing a growth mission and scoping 3 growth areas.

## Growth Ideas

List anything and everything you can think of that you would like to learn, achieve or grown in. Do not limit or edit yourself, list everything you can think of and we'll iterate towards growth area categories.

Examples

- learn Python
- become an expert user of Postgres
- get promoted to Senior Software Engineer
- make a video game
- lead a technical project
- be a better code reviewer
